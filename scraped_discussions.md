Mmmmaybe #eccentric at .125 or so ... but then again, apart from the *very *strong bump at day 2407 I'm not.... really... seeing it on other cycles, so maybe not? Can't quite tell where the dip at the very start of the sample period fits in... It's strong, and wide, much like the dip at 2408 -- But if it is a secondary, then not only is it eccentric, but it shows up only every *other *cycle??? ... multistar system with a 2:1:1 orbital period ??

#NEB with secondary eclipses very close to phase 0.5.

Presumably the two features near phase 0.125 result from the extra dips at the start of the light curve and at about day 2407.
